# Eclipse Che plugin registry

## Build Eclipse Che plugin registry docker image

Execute
```shell
docker build --no-cache -t eclipse/che-plugin-registry .
```
Where `--no-cache` is needed to prevent usage of cached layers with plugin registry files.
Useful when you change plugin metadata files and rebuild the image.

## https://hub.docker.com/

Note that the Dockerfiles feature multi-stage build, so it requires Docker of version 17.05 and higher.
Though you may also just provide the image to the older versions of Docker (ex. on Minishift) by having it build on newer version, and pushing and pulling it from Docker Hub.

```eclipse/che-plugin-registry:latest``` image would be rebuilt after each commit in master

## OpenShift
You can deploy Che plugin registry on Openshift with command.
```
  oc new-app -f openshift/che-plugin-registry.yml \
             -p IMAGE="eclipse/che-plugin-registry" \
             -p IMAGE_TAG="latest" \
             -p PULL_POLICY="IfNotPresent"
```

## Kubernetes

You can deploy Che plugin registry on Kubernetes using [helm](https://docs.helm.sh/). For example if you want to deploy it in the namespace `kube-che` and you are using `minikube` you can use the following command.

```bash

NAMESPACE="kube-che"
DOMAIN="$(minikube ip).nip.io"
helm upgrade --install che-plugin-registry \
    --debug \
    --namespace ${NAMESPACE} \
    --set global.ingressDomain=${DOMAIN} \
    ./kubernetes/che-plugin-registry/

```

You can use the following command to uninstall it.

```bash

helm delete --purge che-plugin-registry

```

## Docker
```
docker run -it  --rm  -p 8080:8080 eclipse/che-plugin-registry
```
### Plugin meta YAML structure:

        - name:
          value:

        - mountPath:

    - https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools/releases/download/0.1.17/vscode-kubernetes-tools-0.1.17.vsix # example
    - vscode:extension/redhat.vscode-xml # example
    - https://github.com/redhat-developer/omnisharp-theia-plugin/releases/download/v0.0.1/omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia # example
```

1 - Category must be equal to one of the following: "Editor", "Debugger", "Formatter", "Language", "Linter", "Snippet", "Theme", "Other"

2 - firstPublicationDate is not required to be present in YAML, as if not present, it will be generated during Plugin Registry dockerimage build

3 - latestUpdateDate is not required to be present in YAML, as it will be generated during Plugin Registry dockerimage build

Note that the `spec` section above comes from the older `che-plugin.yaml` spec. The `endpoints`, `containers`, and `workspaceEnv` are passed back to Che server and are used to define the sidecar that is added to the workspace.

At the moment, some of these fields (that are related to plugin viewer) are validated during the Plugin Registry dockerimage build.
